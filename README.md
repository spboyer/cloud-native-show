Why .NET Core for Cloud Native? That is what we are here to show you. In this series, we talk with industry experts, the engineers and customers building apps and using .NET Core for cloud native solutions.

In each episode, we'll have a conversation about the concepts of why and how each aspect of cloud native practices can be used to construct a robust, scalable and reliable application using .NET Core.

Beyond just talking about the ideas, join us on Twitch every few weeks to build a real application using the practices and components our guests discuss with us.

Cloud Native â€“ what is it? Loosley defined, it's running scalable applications in the cloud using containers, microservices, and immutable infrastructure managed with through devops. I'm going to talk to Brendan Burns and find out what it really means today.

### [2: Why .NET Core for Cloud Native Apps](./episodesepisode2-whydotnetcore.md)

Each service of a cloud native application is developed with the language and/or framework best suited for the job. APIs, serverless, web applications, and streaming services are a few examples. .NET Core is language built right on campus, let's go talk to Scott Hunter to find out why NET Core should be a first thought for cloud native apps.

### [3: DevOps and deploying an application](./episodes/episode3-devops.md)

Cloud native is containers, microservices and serverless that run in multicloud environments and are managed through DevOps processes and principles. The relationship between DevOps and cloud native applications is not always clearly defined. In this episode, Abel joins us to explain the key aspects of the relationship and why DevOps are important to cloud native apps.

### [4: Configuration and settings](./episodes/episode4-dotnetcoreconfig.md)

One of the factors in cloud native applications states you should store your configuration and settings outside of your core application code. In this episode, Andrew gives us a run down on how the configuration options in .NET Core allows for layers of configurability and abtractions for your app.

### [5: Azure Application Configuration](./episodes/episode5-azureappconfig.md)

Azure App Configuration is a developer-focused service in Azure that manages and distributes application settings. It helps implement patterns, such as the 12-factor app, and is particularly useful for cloud native and other distributed applications. In this episode, we'll discuss how you can use Azure App Configuration to simplify management of and secure access to your application settings.

### [6: Serverless, where does it fit?](./episodes/episode6-serverless.md)

A critical characteristic of cloud native architectures it the ability to dynamically scale and support massive numbers of users, events, and requests on these distributed applications and teams. Serverless can help in handling these challenges without having to worry about infrastructure or even an entire application. Jeff jumps into the show production and chats with us on how this fits into the plan for cloud native apps.

Cloud Native Show Live Episode #1 with Shayne and Glenn. They talk about Cloud Native development and build out a weather API application. First, they'll show you how to build an API with configuration and building an Azure DevOps pipeline. That pipeline will build a container image to push it to an Azure Container Registry.
